Windows/MFC local/private resource folder helpers

This is a simple set of Windows/MFC utility functions and classes for
finding and loading language or other private resource modules at runtime.

The LocalRes implementation depends on the MPath utility class from:
https://github.com/manusoft-gh/manusoft-mpath

To use the class, add the LocalRes.cpp and LocalRes.h files to your project
and include the header file:

#include "LocalRes.h"
